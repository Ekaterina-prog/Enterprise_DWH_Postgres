Architecture Overview: DWH (Kimball, PostgreSQL)

1. Source Layer
Source system: PostgreSQL database dvdrental.

Connection is implemented via postgres_fdw.
Source tables are imported into schema film_src.

The Source layer contains no business transformations — it reflects the operational system structure as-is.

2. Staging Layer
Schema: staging

Purpose
- Intermediate storage
- Minimal technical transformation
- Preparation for Core loading
- Incremental data processing

Key Characteristics
- Full load for small reference tables
- Incremental load for inventory, rental, payment
- Soft delete support (deleted column)
- Load control via staging.last_update

Centralized Load Time Control
- staging.get_last_update_table(table_name)
- staging.set_table_load_time(table_name, current_update_dt)

The staging layer:
- Does not contain surrogate keys
- Does not implement business logic
- Mirrors source structure with technical extensions (last_update, deleted)

Implemented Tables
film, inventory, rental, payment, staff, address, city, store

3. Core Layer (Star Schema – Kimball)
Schema: core

A dimensional model implemented using Kimball methodology.
Facts reference dimensions via surrogate keys.

Dimensions
dim_date
Calendar dimension generated via core.load_date.

Includes:
- Day, month, quarter, year
- ISO week, week_of_year
- First/last day of period
- Weekend indicator

dim_inventory (SCD Type 2)
Implements Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2.

Historical fields:
- effective_date_from
- effective_date_to
- is_active

Denormalized attributes from film:
- title
- rental_duration
- rental_rate
- length
- rating
Any change in film attributes creates a new dimension version, ensuring historical correctness of facts.

dim_staff
Fully reloaded dimension (no SCD logic).

4. Fact Tables
fact_rental
Transaction-level fact table.

Contains:
- rental_id
- inventory_fk
- staff_fk
- rental_date_fk
- return_date_fk

Implements SCD Type 2.
New version is created when:
- staff_id
- inventory_id
- rental_date
- return_date (if already populated and changed)
If return_date was NULL and becomes populated for the first time, an UPDATE is performed without versioning.

fact_payment
Contains:
- payment_id
- amount
- rental_id
- payment_date_fk
- inventory_fk
- staff_fk

Implements:
- Incremental loading
- Soft delete handling
- SCD Type 2 (business-event auditing)

Versioning is triggered by changes in:
-amount
-rental_id
- payment_date
Changes in surrogate keys only trigger UPDATE (no new version).
Historical logic is applied to preserve business-event auditability.

5. Data Mart Layer
Schema: report

Aggregated fact tables:
- report.sales_date
- report.sales_film

Procedures:
- report.sales_date_calc()
-report.sales_film_calc()

Purpose:
- Performance optimization
- Reduced load on transactional facts
- Pre-calculated metrics

6. Loading Strategy
Hybrid strategy:

Incremental Load
- staging.inventory
- staging.rental
- staging.payment

SCD Type 2
- core.dim_inventory
- core.fact_rental
- core.fact_payment

Full Reload
- dim_staff
- film (reference)
Calendar dimension generated separately.

Unified Load Timestamp
full_load() uses a single timestamp:

declare current_update_dt timestamp = now();

This timestamp is passed to all staging procedures to ensure consistency and eliminate data desynchronization.

7. Architectural Value
The implemented solution provides:
- Incremental processing without full fact truncation
- Soft delete support
- Historical tracking in dimensions and facts
- Correct linkage between fact and dimension versions
- Business-event auditability
- Reproducible reporting snapshots
- Improved scalability through reduced full reload operations

8. Fact Table Types

Transaction Fact Tables
- fact_rental
- fact_payment

Characteristics:
- One row per business event
- Maximum granularity
- Fully additive metrics (amount)

Accumulating Snapshot (Partially Implemented)
fact_rental tracks lifecycle updates (e.g., return_date), enabling:
- Rental duration analysis
- Delay tracking
- Process stage monitoring

Aggregate Fact Tables
- report.sales_date
- report.sales_film

Used for:
- Faster reporting
- Pre-aggregated analytics
- Reduced workload on transactional facts

Semi-Additive and Non-Additive Metrics
Conceptual examples:
- Inventory balances → semi-additive
- Ratios and percentages → non-additive
The project demonstrates understanding of different fact behaviors and their architectural implications.

9. Further Learning: Inmon Architecture (In Progress)
After completing the Kimball implementation, the project continues with the Inmon enterprise data warehouse approach.

Currently Implemented
- Staging layer
- ODS layer (current operational state)
- REF layer (surrogate key mapping)
- Transactional ETL process

Planned Next
- Integration layer
- DDS (historical detailed storage)
- Data marts built on top of DDS
- Architectural comparison: Kimball vs Inmon

10. Inmon Architecture (Enterprise DWH Approach)
In addition to the Kimball dimensional model, the repository implements the Inmon enterprise architecture.

Implemented Layers

Staging
Raw data ingestion from source (PostgreSQL dvdrental).

ODS (Operational Data Store)
Current-state operational layer with incremental logic and technical fields (last_update, deleted).

REF
Surrogate key mapping layer.
Natural keys are mapped to enterprise surrogate identifiers.

Integration Layer (3NF Transformation)
Schema: integration

Purpose:
- Transform ODS data into enterprise 3NF structure
- Replace natural keys with surrogate keys
- Prepare data for historical storage (DDS)

Characteristics:
- Based on ODS
- Full reload for small reference tables (film, inventory)
- Incremental processing for transactional tables (rental)
- No date dimension at this stage (timestamps preserved)
This layer represents the transformation from operational store to enterprise warehouse.

DDS Layer (Historical Storage)
Schema: dds

Purpose:
- Preserve historical state of reference data
- Support time-based enterprise reporting

Hitorical tracking is implemented for:
- film
- inventory

Change detection is performed using row-level hashing:
md5(row::text)

If hash changes:
- previous version is closed
- new version is inserted

Fields added:
- date_effective_from
- date_effective_to
- is_active
-hash
Dates are not normalized here (unlike Kimball).
Date dimensions are created later at the data mart level if required.

Architectural Perspective

Kimball:
- Dimensional model first (Star Schema)
- Reporting-oriented
- Optimized for performance

Inmon:
- Enterprise 3NF warehouse first
- Centralized historical storage (DDS)
- Data marts built on top of integrated warehouse
The project demonstrates practical implementation of both approaches within PostgreSQL and highlights architectural trade-offs.

11. Inmon Data Mart Layer

A reporting layer (06_report) is implemented on top of the DDS layer.
It includes a calendar dimension and a sales_by_date data mart with a dedicated function returning formatted sales results for visualization.
